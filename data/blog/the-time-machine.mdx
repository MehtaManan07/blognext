# Definition

Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that can make it hard to fall asleep, hard to stay
asleep, or cause you to wake up too early and not be able to get back to sleep. You may
still feel tired when you wake up. Insomnia can sap not only your energy level and mood
but also your health, work performance and quality of life.

# Non-Scientific Reason

- Stress. Concerns about work, school, health, finances or family can keep your
  mind active at night, making it difficult to sleep. Stressful life events or trauma —
  such as the death or illness of a loved one, divorce, or a job loss — also may
  lead to insomnia.
- Travel or work schedule. Your circadian rhythms act as an internal clock,
  guiding such things as your sleep-wake cycle, metabolism and body
  temperature. Disrupting your body's circadian rhythms can lead to insomnia.
  Causes include jet lag from traveling across multiple time zones, working a late
  or early shift, or frequently changing shifts.
- Poor sleep habits. Poor sleep habits include an irregular bedtime schedule,
  naps, stimulating activities before bed, an uncomfortable sleep environment, and
  using your bed for work, eating or watching TV. Computers, TVs, video games,
  smartphones or other screens just before bed can interfere with your sleep cycle.
- Medications. Many prescription drugs can interfere with sleep, such as certain
  antidepressants and medications for asthma or blood pressure. Many over-thecounter medications — such as some pain medications, allergy and cold
  medications, and weight-loss products — contain caffeine and other stimulants
  that can disrupt sleep.

# Scientific Reason

There have been various models that have been proposed by scientists to describe how
chronic primary insomnia arises. Some of these are-

- 3P model (Predisposing, Perpetuating, and Precipitating)
  Also known as the Spielman model of chronic insomnia, it mainly has 3
  components: predisposing factors, perpetuating factors, and precipitating factors.
  As per this model, predisposing factors can cause occasional instances of poor
  sleep at night, but in general, the person sleeps well until a precipitating event ( for
  e.g., passing away of a loved one) occurs, which actually triggers acute insomnia.
  In case the person develops bad sleep habits or other perpetuating factors set in;
  insomnia becomes chronic and persists even after the removal of the precipitating
  factor.
- Cognitive model
  This model suggests that insomniacs
  (people suffering from the condition)
  are extremely worried about sleep
  and the consequences of not having
  enough it. This kind of thought pattern
  triggers stress and arousal, thus
  increasing anxiety and sleep
  problems as they tend to actively
  monitor their environment for sleeprelated issues such as body
  sensations, disturbing noises, etc.
- Neurocognitive model
  As per this model, people with insomnia are seen with more high-frequency
  electrical activity in the brain (EEG) during sleep time when compared with other
  normal sleepers. This kind of cortical arousal indicates enhanced sensory or
  information processing in insomniacs, causing acute sleep problems.

# How Nutraceuticals can help

Remarkable positive effects of nutraceuticals like Caffeine, Chamomile, Kava kava,
Cherries and Cherry juice, L tryptophan, Valerian, Vitamin D, Marijuana, melatonin,
Lemon balm had been mentioned in the treatment of sleep disorders.
