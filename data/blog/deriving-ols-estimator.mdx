# Definition

Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension. It can come from any event or thought

# Scientific Reason

A stressful event creates a release of hormones, called cortisol, by the
hypothalamus through the adrenal glands into the blood stream. Your
blood sugar increases, adrenaline causes a more rapid heart rate and
oxygen fills your muscles creating tension. Acute stress takes about 90 minutes for the metabolism to return to normal when the response is over.4 Chronic stress, that is maintained at a lower level but for a longer period of time, can have lifelong health implications. In fact, according to Harvard Medical School, “repeated
activation of the stress response takes a toll on the body. Research suggests that chronic
stress contributes to high blood pressure, promotes the formation of artery-clogging
deposits, and causes brain changes that may contribute to anxiety, depression, and
addiction. More preliminary research suggests that chronic stress may also contribute to
obesity, both through direct mechanisms (causing people to eat more) or indirectly
(decreasing sleep and exercise)”.2 This is true for chronic low-level stress as well as
repeated episodes of high-level stress. Chronic stress is more challenging than acute
stress as the continual source of stress does not allow the body a chance to correct itself
and return to normal functioning. Symptoms can manifest as sleep disorders, digestive
challenges, cardiovascular episodes, headaches, overall anxiety and more

# How Nutraceuticals can help

Nutrients such as fish oil, B vitamins, and vitamin D have all been shown to interact with
multiple pathways in our body that can affect mental illness. These include pathways such
as inflammation, an imbalanced gut microbiome (learn more about the gut here), a
reduction in the growth of brain cells (also called neurogenesis), and the production of
free radicals
