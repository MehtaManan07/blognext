# Definition

Intense, excessive, and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Fast heart
rate, rapid breathing, sweating, and feeling tired may occur

## Non-Scientific Reason

- Trauma. Children who endured abuse or trauma or witnessed traumatic events
  are at higher risk of developing an anxiety disorder at some point in life. Adults
  who experience a traumatic event also can develop anxiety disorders
- Stress due to an illness. Having a health condition or serious illness can cause
  significant worry about issues such as your treatment and your future.
- Stress buildup. A big event or a buildup of smaller stressful life situations may
  trigger excessive anxiety â€” for example, a death in the family, work stress or
  ongoing worry about finances
- Personality. People with certain personality types are more prone to anxiety
  disorders than others are.
- Other mental health disorders. People with other mental health disorders, such
  as depression, often also have an anxiety disorder
- Having blood relatives with an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders can run in
  families

## How Nutraceuticals can help
