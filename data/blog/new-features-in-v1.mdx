Nutraceutical is a combination of the wordâ€™s "nutrition" and "pharmaceutical." In general,
nutraceuticals are foods or parts of foods that play a substantial role in changing and
sustaining proper physiological function in humans. The present demographic and health
trends are the primary drivers of the nutraceutical market's global expansion. Dietary fibre,
probiotics, polyunsaturated fatty acids, antioxidants, and other forms of herbal/natural
foods are all examples of food products utilized as nutraceuticals.

These nutraceuticals aid in the treatment of some of the century's most pressing health
issues, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, arthritis,
diabetes, and cholesterol. Overall, the term "nutraceutical" has ushered in a new era of
medicine and health, in which the food industry has evolved into a research-driven
industry.

In recent years, a new diet-health paradigm has emerged, emphasizing the positive
elements of eating. People's basic eating habits have changed as a result of their new
lifestyle. Junk food consumption has risen dramatically, resulting in a slew of ailments
linked to poor nutrition. Obesity has now been identified as a global problem.

Heart disease is still the leading cause of death in most developing countries, followed by
cancer, osteoporosis, arthritis, and a variety of other diseases. Consumers who are
dissatisfied with mainstream medicine's pricey, high-tech disease-treatment strategy are
looking for complementary or alternative treatments.

Nutraceuticals are particularly appealing due to their beneficial goods and the red tape of
managed care. "Let food be thy medicine, and medicine be thy food," Hippocrates said
around 2,500 years ago, and it's still true today. Nutraceuticals are a new category of
natural goods that blur the border between food and medicine.

Nutraceuticals are foods that have been prepared specifically to meet certain dietary
needs and/or to give medical or health advantages. Nutraceuticals are immensely popular
due to a lack of medical assistance, broad scepticism of allopathic medications, and food
fads. They are employed in a variety of industries, including pharmaceutical food and
beverages, animal feed additives, and personal healthcare, due to their versatility. Recent
breakthroughs and discoveries of function-specific antioxidants are likely to open up new
doors in this burgeoning industry
