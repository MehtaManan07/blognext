# Definition

Depression is a a negative affective state, ranging from unhappiness and discontent to
an extreme feeling of sadness, pessimism, and despondency, that interferes with daily
life. Various physical, cognitive, and social changes also tend to co-occur, including
altered eating or sleeping habits, lack of energy or motivation, difficulty concentrating or
making decisions, and withdrawal from social activities. It is symptomatic of a number of
mental health disorders.

# Non scientific reasons

- Abuse. Physical, sexual, or emotional abuse can make you more vulnerable to
  depression later in life.
- Age. People who are elderly are at higher risk of depression. That can be made
  worse by other factors, such as living alone and having a lack of social support.
- Certain medications. Some drugs, such as isotretinoin (used to treat acne), the
  antiviral drug interferon-alpha, and corticosteroids, can increase your risk of
  depression.
- Conflict. Depression in someone who has the biological vulnerability to it may
  result from personal conflicts or disputes with family members or friends.
- Gender. Women are about twice as likely as men to become depressed. No
  one's sure why. The hormonal changes that women go through at different times
  of their lives may play a role.
- Genes. A family history of depression may increase the risk. It's thought that
  depression is a complex trait, meaning there are probably many different genes
  that each exert small effects, rather than a single gene that contributes to
  disease risk. The genetics of depression, like most psychiatric disorders, are not
  as simple or straightforward as in purely genetic diseases such as Huntington's
  chorea or cystic fibrosis.
- Major events. Even good events such as starting a new job, graduating, or
  getting married can lead to depression. So can moving, losing a job or income,
  getting divorced, or retiring. However, the syndrome of clinical depression is
  never just a "normal" response to stressful life events.
- Other personal problems. Problems such as social isolation due to other
  mental illnesses or being cast out of a family or social group can contribute to the
  risk of developing clinical depression.
- Serious illnesses. Sometimes, depression happens along with a major illness or
  may be triggered by another medical condition.
- Substance misuse. Nearly 30% of people with substance misuse problems also
  have major or clinical depression. Even if drugs or alcohol temporarily make you
  feel better, they ultimately will aggravate depression

# How Nutraceuticals can solve it

Current evidence supports adjunctive use of SAMe, methylfolate, omega-3, and vitamin
D with antidepressants to reduce depressive symptoms.
