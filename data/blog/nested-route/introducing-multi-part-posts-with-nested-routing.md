The brain is one of the body's largest and most complicated organs. It is made up of over
100 billion nerves that communicate with each other via trillions of synapses. The brain
is made up of a number of specialized sections that collaborate: The cortex is the brain's
outermost layer. The cortex is where thinking and voluntary actions begin. Between the
spinal cord and the remainder of the brain is the brain stem. Breathing and sleep are two
basic functions that are controlled here.

The basal ganglia are a group of structures in the brain's core. The basal ganglia sends
and receives messages from many parts of the brain. The cerebellum is located at the
brain's base and back. The cerebellum is in charge of balance and coordination.

The brain is divided into lobes as well:

Problem solving, judgment, and motor function are all governed by the frontal lobes.
Sensation, penmanship, and bodily posture are all controlled by the parietal lobes.
Memory and hearing are both controlled by the temporal lobes. The visual processing
system of the brain is located in the occipital lobes. The meninges are a layer of tissue
that surrounds the brain. The cranium (skull) protects the brain from injury

## About Brain Health

When your brain is healthy, it receives the blood flow it needs to function at its best. A
healthy brain is necessary for a long and fulfilling existence. When your brain is healthy,
you can pay attention better, solve issues faster, communicate more effectively, and so
much more.

Poor brain health is a serious public health epidemic. The brain begins showing signs of
cognitive decline as a person enters their 20s. Although research is still in its early stages,
there is significant evidence that people can lower their risk of cognitive decline by
adopting crucial lifestyle adjustments such as getting enough exercise, being socially
engaged, and keeping excellent heart health.

The human brain is the nervous system's command centre, enabling ideas, memory,
movement, and emotions through a complicated function that is the pinnacle of biological
evolution. The most important goal in pursuing health and longevity is to maintain a
healthy brain throughout one's life. The burden of neurological illnesses and the difficulty
of maintaining brain health grow as the population ages. As a result, it's critical to
comprehend what brain health is and why it's crucial. This is the first of a series of articles
aimed at defining brain health, examining the impact of major neurological illnesses on
brain health, and discussing how these problems might be treated and avoided.
