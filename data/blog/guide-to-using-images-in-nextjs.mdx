# Introduction

In all countries of the world, the burden of mental diseases continues to rise, posing
serious health risks as well as huge social, human rights, and economic ramifications.

There are many various types of mental diseases, each with its own set of symptoms.
They are characterized by a mix of anomalous thoughts, perceptions, emotions, behavior,
and interpersonal connections.

Depression, bipolar illness, schizophrenia and other psychoses, dementia, and
developmental diseases such as autism are examples of mental disorders.
Mental problems can be treated effectively, and the misery they cause can be alleviated.
It is critical to have access to health care and social services that can provide treatment
and social support.

# 1.1 Depression

Depression is a widespread mental illness that is also one of the leading causes
of disability around the world. Depression affects an estimated 264 million
individuals worldwide. Women are more likely to be affected than males.

Sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, interrupted
sleep or food, weariness, and impaired concentration are all symptoms of
depression. People who are depressed may also experience a variety of bodily
ailments that have no obvious physical reason. Depression can be chronic or
recurrent, limiting people's ability to function at work or school and cope with dayto-day living. Depression can lead to suicide in its most extreme form.

There are also therapies that are effective. Talking therapies, such as cognitive
behavior therapy or psychotherapy, can effectively cure mild to moderate
depression. Antidepressants can be an effective treatment for mild to moderate
depression, however they should not be used as the first line of treatment for mild
depression. They should not be used to treat depression in children, and they
should not be used as the first line of treatment in teenagers, who should be treated
with caution

# 1.2 Bipolar Disorder

Around 45 million people worldwide are affected by this disorder. It usually includes
both manic and depressed episodes, with periods of normal mood in between.
Manic episodes are characterized by a heightened or irritated mood, excessive
activity, quick speech, increased self-esteem, and a reduced desire for sleep.
Bipolar disorder can also be diagnosed in those who have manic episodes but
don't have depressed episodes.

Effective therapies for the acute phase of bipolar disorder and the prevention of
relapse are available. These are mood-stabilizing medications. The importance of
psychosocial assistance in treatment cannot be overstated

# 1.3 Schizophreni

Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that affects 20 million individuals around
the world. Disturbances in thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self,
and behavior characterize psychoses, including schizophrenia. Hallucinations
(hearing, seeing, or feeling things that aren't there) and delusions are common
psychotic experiences (fixed false beliefs or suspicions that are firmly held even
when there is evidence to the contrary). People with the disease may find it difficult
to work or study normally.

Lack of access to health and social services can be caused by stigma and
discrimination. In addition, people with psychosis are more likely to be subjected
to human rights breaches, such as long-term institutionalization. Medicines and
emotional assistance are effective treatments. Affected persons can live
productive lives and integrate into society with the right therapy and social
assistance.

# 1.4 Dementia

Dementia affects around 50 million people worldwide. Dementia is a chronic or
progressive disease in which cognitive function (i.e. the ability to process thoughts)
deteriorates beyond what would be expected with normal aging. Memory,
cognition, orientation, comprehension, computation, learning capacity, language,
and judgment are all affected. Deterioration in emotional regulation, social
behavior, or motivation is frequently associated with, and occasionally preceded
by, cognitive impairment.

Dementia is caused by a range of brain disorders and accidents, including
Alzheimer's disease and stroke. While there is presently no cure for dementia or a
way to slow its progression, many treatments are in various phases of scientific
studies. However, there is much that can be done to help and improve the lives of
people with dementia, as well as their caregivers and relatives
